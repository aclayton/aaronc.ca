  <h2>What is it</h2>
  <p>
    Svg Machine is a single page app (SPA) that I made after reading a <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/">great article</a> by Chris Coyier of <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com">Css Tricks</a> on building svg sprite files using the <code>&#60;defs&#62;</code>, and <code>&#60;use&#62;</code> tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    I really like the idea of having all of a site's icons in an easy to serve definition file which can also act as a self contained library, with the ability to add and extract individual icons. However, to make this approach more user friendly requires an easy to use library manager.
  </p>
  <p>
    To complete the project the ability to live edit the individual svgs was added so all that post export svg clean up <small>(you know I mean)</small> is a snap.
